# Exercise 1
a) O(log(n))
b) O(n log(n))
c) O(n)
d) O(n^2)
e) O(n^3)
f) O(1)
g) O(n log(n))

# Exercise 2

# Exercise 3
a)  O(n log(n)) because it is already sorted therefore you only go through it once.

b) It should be O(n log(n)) because it is already sorted but it still needs to check the array using quicksort.
